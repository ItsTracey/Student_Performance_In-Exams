📊 Student Performance Data Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of 1,000 students to explore the relationship between exam scores and background factors like parental education, test preparation, and reading-writing skill correlations. The goal is to draw meaningful insights using Python's data science tools, and present findings in both code and a polished LaTeX report.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- LaTeX (for report generation)
- hashlib (for simple encryption)

## 📈 Trends Explored

1. **Test Preparation Effectiveness**  
   Students who completed the test prep course scored consistently higher — especially in reading and writing.

2. **Reading vs. Writing Correlation**  
   A strong Pearson correlation coefficient (≈ 0.95) suggests these two skills improve in tandem.

3. **Parental Education Impact**  
   Higher parental education levels are modestly associated with better performance across all subjects.

## 🔒 Bonus: Data Masking

To simulate real-world data privacy, a `student_id` column can be encrypted using SHA-256 hashing. See the encryption logic in `analysis.py`.

## 📄 Report
The final report is written in LaTeX and includes:
-Data cleaning summary
-Visualizations
-Trend analysis with insights
-Optional encryption explanation
